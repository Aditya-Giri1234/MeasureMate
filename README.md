## Installation

### Step 1: Set Up Google Cloud Project

Before integrating Google Sign-In with Firebase, you need to create a project in **Google Cloud Platform** (GCP):

1. **Create a Project in Google Cloud**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project and enable the **Google Identity Platform API**.

2. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**:
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   - Click **Create Credentials > OAuth 2.0 Client ID**.
   - Choose **Android** as the application type.
   - Enter the **package name** and **SHA-1 fingerprint** (from Android Studio).
   - Download the `google-services.json` file.

---

### Step 2: Set Up Firebase Project

Now, integrate Firebase with your Android app:

1. **Create a Firebase Project**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new project and link it with the Google Cloud project you created earlier.

2. **Enable Google Sign-In**:
   - In Firebase Console, go to **Authentication > Sign-in method** and enable **Google** as a sign-in provider.

3. **Add Firebase SDK to Your Project**:
   - Download the `google-services.json` file from Firebase and add it to your Android app's `app/` directory.

4. **Add Dependencies**:
   In your app-level `build.gradle` file, add the following dependencies:

   ```gradle
   dependencies {
       implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:21.0.1'
       implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:20.0.1'
       implementation 'androidx.credentials:credentials:1.1.1'
       implementation 'androidx.credentials:credentials-play-services-auth:1.1.1'
       implementation 'com.google.android.libraries.identity.googleid:googleid:1.1.1'
   }
